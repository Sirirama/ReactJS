can be thought of as a UI component in an app.
Components can be divided into two types one is Functional Component and the
other is Class Components.

render() is the only required method for a React Class Component. React uses
the return value from this method to determine what to render to the page.

JSX stands for JavaScript eXtension, a syntax extension for JavaScript written
by Facebook. Using JSX enables us to write the markup for our component view
in a familiar, HTML like syntax.


Redux is a state management paradigm based on Facebook's Flux architecture.
Redux provides a structure for large state trees and allows you to decouple
user interaction in your app from state change.
