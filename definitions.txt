Building a React app is all about components. An individual React Component
can be thought of as a UI component in an app.
Components can be divided into two types one is Functional Component and the
other is Class Components.

render() is the only required method for a React Class Component. React uses
the return value from this method to determine what to render to the page.

JSX stands for JavaScript eXtension, a syntax extension for JavaScript written
by Facebook. Using JSX enables us to write the markup for our component view
in a familiar, HTML like syntax.

Babel is a JavaScript transpiler. Babel turns ES6 code into ES5 code. We call
this process transpiling. So we can enjoy the features of ES6 today yet ensure
our code still runs in browsers that only support ES5.

Redux is a state management paradigm based on Facebook's Flux architecture.
Redux provides a structure for large state trees and allows you to decouple
user interaction in your app from state change.

Using State
-----------
props are immutable and owned by component's parent, state is owned by the 
component. this.state is private to the component, so we can not update state
properties directly, as we'll updated with this.setState() method.

Critically, when the state or props of a component update, the component will
re-render itself.

Why should not we update the state directly ?
If you try to update the state directly, then it will not re-render the
component.
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            message: 'ReactJS'
        }
    }
//Wrong
this.state.message = 'Hello';

Instead we use setState() method. It schedules an update to component's state
object. When state changes, the component will re-render itself.

//Correct
this.setState({
    message: 'React-Redux'
});

Note: The only place you can directly assign to the state object is in
constructor.

react-router-dom
----------------
There are three types of Components in React Router: router components, route
matching components and navigation components. All of these components should
be imported from react-router-dom.

    import { BrowserRouter, Route, Link } from "react-router-dom";

Routers:
--------
For web projects, react-router-dom provides <BrowserRouter> and <HashRouter>
routers. Both of these will create a specialized history object for you.
Generally we should use <BowserRouter> if you have a server that responds to
request and a <HashRouter> if you are using a static file server.

    import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

    ReactDOM.render(
        <BrowserRouter>
            <App />
        </BrowserRouter>,
        holder
    )

Route Matching:
---------------
There are two route matching components: <Route> and <Switch>

Route matching is done by comparing <Route>'s path prop to the current
location's pathname. When a <Route> matches it will render its content, when
it does not match it will render null.
